# Medical-Cost-Prediction-for-Insurance-Dataset
About Dataset :
The dataset consists of some features about the individual. Our aim is to predict the Medical costs billed by the health insurance with the given features.
Steps to be Followed:
1. Load the Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Data Preparation
4. Model Building
5. Prediction & Evaluation
Since the task is a Regression task, I have performed multiple regression algorithms such as Linear Regressor, KNN, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Ensembles etc. Among all the algorithms Random Forest Regressor performs well with minimum Mean Absolute Error(MAE).
